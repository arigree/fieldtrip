# Kneeling Warrior

## Project Summary

The *Kneeling Warrior* is a painting created in 2004 by artist Douglas Miles. The painting draws inspiration from the San Carlos Apache and Akimel O’odham cultures and introduces a contemporary twist by using a wooden skateboard as its canvas. 

This artwork is historically significant because it challenges traditional perceptions of Native American art, blending cultural heritage with modern mediums. I chose this work because of the powerful message Douglas Miles communicates through his art—honoring Indigenous identity while pushing the boundaries of artistic expression.
